# cisc3140
- Repository for CISC 3140 class
- Throughout this class, we learned how to create a full-stack application, and learned the necessary technologies and paradigms that fall into it. Given a CSV file regarding Car Contest data, we learned how to create a database containing filtered tables of that data, a RESTful api server, and a pretty front-end.

## Lab 1
- We learned and applied **AWK** Scripts to a data.csv file we received, and practiced filtering and manipulating raw data to create the instructed data frames.

## Lab 2
- We learned the SQL & SQLite3 to create a database for the original data.csv file and queried and manipulated the data.csv file to create the instructed tables. 

## Lab 4
- We learned back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful api that supported GET/POST/PATCH requests to our database. 

## Lab 5
- We used front-end libraries such as Bootstrap.js and React.js to create a front-end that users can interact with to see what's in the database.
