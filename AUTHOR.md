Hey my name is Adnaan Syed I am doing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I also participated in the web dev course offered by Cuny Tech Prep and the Data Analytics course offered by CUNY EverUp. I am still trying to figure out the niche of CS I wanna fall into, so I want to explore different fields to see what sticks out to me.

Outside of coding, I usually spend time with family and some light reading and exercise.
